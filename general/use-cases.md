# Nordek Mobile Infrastructure Use Cases

With its highly customizable nature, Nordek's mobile-centric infrastructure offers a wide range of potential applications for issuing tokens and building communities around them.

Companies and organizations can utilize Nordek Studio or Nordek Studio in combination with a customized version of Nordek Wallet to create tokens for users onboarded to their own app or a customized version of Nordek Wallet. They can also whitelist businesses for the token community ecosystem and enable fiat on-ramps.

Below are a few implemented token community use cases to provide examples:

## A Stable Currency for a Local Economy

Community creators on Nordek Studio can choose to use either a newly issued token or an existing one. For instance, the Kolektivo project in Cura√ßao utilizes the popular DAI stablecoin to issue the CuraDAI stable currency, pegged to the Antillean Guilder.&#x20;

The CuraDAI token and its associated mobile app aim to facilitate local goods production, trade, and community engagement.

This example highlights the low cost and ease of creating and managing token communities and payment systems on Nordek.

## A Customer Rewards Token and Food Delivery app

The PeeplEat project in Liverpool, UK, leverages Nordek to develop a mobile app for food delivery.&#x20;

The PEEPL token is designed to incentivize customer loyalty, where customers receive rewards in PEEPL tokens with every order placed through the PeeplEat app.

The advantages of using Nordek technology for customer rewards include automation and transparency. Rewards are automatically distributed based on actual transactions, ensuring that the rewards token's supply is not inflated over time. Users can also verify reward amounts and total supply.

## A Festival Payments Token

In November 2020, Bitazza utilized Nordek Studio to issue a payments token for the Mystic Valley Festival in Thailand. They also customized Nordek Wallet to create a mobile app specifically for the festival.&#x20;

The app and token seamlessly facilitated over 15,000 transactions made by festival attendees during the 3-day event.

Nordek's mobile infrastructure assists event organizers in reducing the costs of managing internal payments while significantly improving the customer experience by replacing legacy solutions like physical payment tokens or refillable cards at a low cost.

## A Solution for Streamlining Charitable Donations

The Communitaria project (formerly known as Wikibank) has utilized Nordek's B2B technology to address an important challenge in the charity industry. They launched a token that is backed one-to-one by donated funds, which can only be spent by beneficiaries using the project's mobile app. These tokens are exclusively used for purchasing fresh produce from participating shops.

This approach provides assurance to donors that their funds will be used solely for the intended purpose of enabling beneficiaries to buy fresh food. Other NGOs and charitable projects can also enhance the targeting and transparency of their donations by leveraging Nordek's technology.
