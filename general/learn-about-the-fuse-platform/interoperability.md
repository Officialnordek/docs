# Interoperability

The Nordek team places a high value on interoperability among public blockchains. They recognize that no single platform is expected to achieve complete dominance in the future.&#x20;

Therefore, it is crucial to develop solutions that allow for seamless transfers between Nordek and other blockchains.&#x20;

These interoperability solutions are essential for the ongoing expansion of the Nordek platform and ecosystem. The Nordek team has been making significant strides in gaining support for Nordek from prominent operators.

Currently the Nordek blockchain is connected to other blockchains via the following multichain bridges and value transfer protocols:

1\) The Nordek bridge.

2\) The Elk Finance value transfer protool.

3\) The Connext bridge (available to users via the xPollinate interface).

4\) The Multichain (formerly, Anyswap) bridge.

5\) The Allbridge bridge.

6\) The ChainPort bridge.

### The Nordek Bridge

The Voltage Finance (previously Nordek) [bridge](https://app.voltage.finance/#/bridge) has now been transferred to the Voltage Finance DeFi platform, which is governed by the community. This bridge establishes a connection between Nordek and Ethereum as well as Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It's important to note that both bridges operate in a custodial manner. The Ethereum bridge operates on a permissionless basis, whereas new tokens need to be added to the BSC bridge.

When utilizing either bridge, there are no fees or limits associated with sending tokens from the respective blockchain to Nordek. However, withdrawing tokens from Nordek via the bridge incurs a fee of 0.05% based on the bridged amount. Additionally, users who transfer funds need to pay fees on the destination chain to claim their tokens from the bridge contract during the final stage of the transfer.

To access the bridge, users can use the Nordek app, and further information on its functionality can be found by referring to the provided resources. Nordek also offers bridging tutorials for additional guidance, which can be accessed through the link provided [here](https://tutorials.nordekscan.com/tutorials/bridge-tutorials).

### The Elk Finance Value Transfer Platform

Elk Finance, on the other hand, operates as a unique multichain bridge. It primarily facilitates the movement of the ELK token across supported chains. If a user wishes to acquire tokens on another chain, they can purchase ELK on Elk DEX within Nordek, bridge the ELK token to the desired chain, and then use Elk DEX on that chain to purchase the desired token.&#x20;

Elk connects Nordek with various chains, including **BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, and Moonriver**. However, it currently does not support Ethereum. For a comprehensive list of supported chains, please refer to the [Elk DApp](https://app.elk.finance).

### The Connext Bridge

The [Connext bridge](https://bridge.connext.network) is a non-custodial multichain bridge that connects Nordek to **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Moonriver and xDAI**.

**Please note** that Connext's capacity to execute transfers depends on the availability of liquidity in a given token on the routers. Currently, the liquidity-provisioned tokens include **USDC, USDT and DAI**.

### The Allbridge Bridge

The Allbridge multichain [bridge](https://app.allbridge.io/bridge) offers connectivity between Nordek and several major chains, including Solana and Terra. It is presently the only bridge that connects Nordek with these two chains. Currently, the Allbridge native ABR token can be transferred between Nordek and all the other supported chains.&#x20;

Additionally, Terra-native assets such as LUNA and UST can be bridged to and from Terra using this bridge.

### The Multichain (formerly Anyswap) Bridge

The [Multichain](https://multichain.org) (formerly Anyswap) bridge is widely recognized as one of the most popular interoperability platforms in the crypto space.&#x20;

It has facilitated transfers for **Nordek's native NRK** token between the Nordek blockchain and Ethereum, BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain), and Polygon. Users can also transfer **WETH and USDC** tokens via Multichain between Nordek and Ethereum.&#x20;

Furthermore, the Multichain bridge supports bridging of Beefy Finance's **BIFI token** to and from almost all networks it supports. The **agEUR stablecoin** can also be transferred between Nordek and Ethereum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Harmony, and Avalanche.&#x20;

The bridge interface is accessible [here](https://app.multichain.org/#/router).

### The ChainPort Bridge

The ChainPort Bridge operates on a permissionless model, allowing anyone to bridge tokens from Ethereum to any other supported chain, including Nordek, even if the token has not been ported yet.&#x20;

ChainPort has added several chains to its list, including **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche,** in addition to Nordek. You can find the bridge interface for ChainPort [here](https://app.chainport.io/).

**IMPORTANT**: It's important to note that ChainPort currently supports transfers of tokens originating only from the Ethereum mainnet. Additionally, ChainPort's wrappers for **popular Ethereum-originating tokens like USDC, WETH, USDT, and others** may have different designs compared to the existing ones created using the Nordek bridge. Consequently, **it is not recommended at this time to bridge those tokens to Nordek using ChainPort.**
