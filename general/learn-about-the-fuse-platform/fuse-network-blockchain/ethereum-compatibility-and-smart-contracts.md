# Ethereum (EVM) Compatibility and Smart Contracts

In addition to processing transactions, Nordek nodes also store and update the code and current state of smart contracts. Smart contracts are computer programs or persistent scripts that can be interacted with by sending transactions to invoke their functions. These smart contracts have their own accounts that can hold token balances.

Smart contracts on the Nordek network are stored and executed within a specialized environment known as the "virtual machine" (VM). The Nordek blockchain is currently designed to be broadly compatible with Ethereum's virtual machine (EVM).

As a result, any smart contract or decentralized application (dApp) that can be deployed on Ethereum or another EVM-compatible chain can also be deployed and function on Nordek. This includes contracts adhering to standards such as TL20 and ERC721. No modifications to the smart contract code are necessary for deployment on Nordek.
