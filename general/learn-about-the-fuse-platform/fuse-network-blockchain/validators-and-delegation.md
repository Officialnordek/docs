# Delegation through Staking with Validators

As mentioned previously, Nordek validators have the opportunity to increase their share of the overall consensus stake by attracting funds from users who do not run validator nodes themselves. These users are known as "delegators." A delegator has the freedom to select any validator (or multiple validators) and stake any amount of NRK tokens with them to participate in the consensus.

The Nordek Staking [platform](https://staking.nordekscan.com) provides a convenient way for delegators to delegate their NRK tokens to a validator. By doing so, delegators are entitled to receive a share of the Nordek block rewards that is proportionate to their stake, minus the fee paid to their chosen validator. The minimum fee currently stands at 15%. This fee percentage has been set to prevent excessive consolidation of validators by discouraging very low delegation fees.

At present, delegators have the flexibility to unstake their NRK tokens at any time. However, plans are underway to introduce a minimum staking period, which would impose a required duration for which tokens must remain staked.
