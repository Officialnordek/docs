# Nordek Governance and Development

Nordek is already a considerably decentralized platform, and there are plans underway to ultimately achieve complete community control over it in the future. The governance of Nordek is presently shared among the following entities:

1. **Network Validators**: Nordek validators play a crucial role in determining the adoption of  [Nordek improvement proposals](https://docs.nordekscan.com/general/fips) (NIPs). At present, each validator holds one vote, regardless of their share of the overall network stake. However, it is anticipated that this arrangement will undergo modifications in the near future.
2. **Nordek Foundation and the Project Team**: Similar to many public blockchain projects in their early stages of development, the Nordek Foundation, operated by Nordek Limited, currently plays a significant role in managing the core network protocol and the Nordek treasury, which primarily consists of the undistributed genesis NRK supply (refer to the  "[NRK Supply and Current Distribution](https://docs.nordekscan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)") subsection for more details).

The Nordek Foundation employs a dedicated project team, whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://nordekscan.com/about).

The project team is responsible for various tasks, including implementing network protocol updates approved by the validators, making other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, and maintaining the full node software. They also focus on developing a mobile-centric infrastructure to facilitate the creation and management of token communities on the Nordek platform.&#x20;

Moreover, the team works towards increasing the adoption of the network by enhancing the Nordek tech stack, establishing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects, and promoting the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

However, it is important to note that Nordek is a decentralized public blockchain platform.&#x20;

Consequently, no permission from the project team is required for individuals or entities who wish to integrate with or develop on top of Nordek. This includes activities such as developing the network and node software. Nordek encourages an open and permissionless approach to foster innovation and collaboration within its ecosystem.
