# Nordek Assembly

Nordek Assembly serves as a governance body comprised of active members within the Nordek community. Its formation marks the initial step towards transitioning full governance and ownership of the Nordek platform to the community.

Currently, Nordek Assembly consists of five independent Nordek ecosystem members who have demonstrated consistent dedication and commitment to the project. These individuals already possess a voice within the community.

The current role of Nordek Assembly encompasses the following responsibilities:

* Taking control of the [Nordek Forum](http://www.nordek.io/) community discussion platform.
* Implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on Nordek.
* Managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

The Community Token Pool is a vital aspect of Nordek Assembly's operations. Initially, the assembly's budget will be constituted by this pool. Each month, 200,000 NRK will be allocated from the Nordek Bootstrap Pool (details discussed [here](https://docs.nordekscan.com/general/fuse-token/fuse-supply-and-current-distribution)) to the Community Token Pool.

Nordek Assembly will regularly distribute funds from the Community Token Pool to finance grants, bounties, marketing initiatives, and other projects designed to support and foster communities building on the Nordek platform. The aim is to drive innovation and facilitate the growth of the ecosystem.
