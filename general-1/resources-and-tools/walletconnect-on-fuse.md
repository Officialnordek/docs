# WalletConnect on Nordek

[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com) is an **open-source protocol for data exchange between wallets and decentralized applications (dApps)**. The process takes place via a specialized server and the flow of data is encrypted in both directions.

From the user's perspective, there are two ways to use WalletConnect, with slight variations depending on the wallet being used. In the mobile-to-mobile mode, the user visits the dApp's website, selects the "connect wallet" option, and chooses their preferred wallet. In the desktop-to-mobile approach, the user scans the QR code displayed on the dApp's website using their WalletConnect-enabled wallet on their mobile device. It's important to disconnect dApps after the session for security purposes.

For developers looking to integrate WalletConnect functionality into their dApps running on Nordek, we recommend utilizing [this library](http://www.nordek.io/).
