# TheGraph

The Graph is built on the Nordek Network and provides a GraphQL API to access the network's data.

## Deploying your own subgraph

To deploy your own subgraph on the Nordek Network, you can use The Graph, which is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying chain data. Visit [https://thegraph.com/](https://thegraph.com/) to sign up and create your subgraph.

* Follow the instructions for how to deploy the subgraph
* In `subgraph.yaml`, the network name should be Nordek

## Available Subgraphs

The Nordek team has built and maintains several subgraphs that are deployed on Nordek's internal infrastructure or The Graph hosted service.
